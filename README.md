# Go on Exercism: Solutions to Exercises

These are my solutions to the exercises of the [Go track](https://exercism.org/tracks/go) on [Exercism](https://exercism.org).

## Learning Exercises

These are completed during the Go track's "Learning Mode" to illustrate important language [concepts](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/concepts). They're invariably short and simple, and there generally aren't too many reasonable ways to solve them, but they can provide nice examples of Go features and built-in functions.

### Animal Magic

The `math/rand` package provides a convenient `Shuffle` function.


### Blackjack

A very simple exercise, but also a nice showcase of Go's `switch` statement.

### Chessboard

Every function in my solution uses a bare return.

### Gross Store

You can include a simple statement (like a variable declaration) with a tagless `switch`; just remember to add a semicolon after the statement. See the `RemoveItem` function for an example.

### Lasagna Master

The `Quantities` function provides an opportunity to use a *bare return*.

## Practice Exercises

These are meant for students who've completed Learning Mode or otherwise acquired basic Go proficiency, and vary considerably in length and difficulty.
