# Go on Exercism: Solutions to Exercises

These are my solutions to the exercises of the [Go track](https://exercism.org/tracks/go) on [Exercism](https://exercism.org).

## Animal Magic

The `math/rand` package provides a convenient `Shuffle` function.


## Blackjack

A very simple exercise, but also a nice showcase of Go's `switch` statement.

## Lasagna Master

The `Quantities` function provides an opportunity to use a *bare return*.
